# ZBasic

This project provides a very basic version of a working
[ZipCPU](https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu) system.  It is designed so that
others (you perhaps?) can then build off of it and design with it.
ZBasic has three primary goals:

- To provide a usable beginning system to allow users to get *something* up and running quickly

- To provide a very basic system that can then be matched with an emulator, and used to test library and compiler functionality apart from actual hardware.

- To demonstrate the utility of [autofpga](https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga), and its ability to quickly, easily, and seemlessly add components to a design

If you'd like to give this a spin, consider the instructions
[in this article](http://zipcpu.com/zipcpu/2018/02/12/zbasic-intro.html)
describing how to do so.

# Status

The ZBasic system can now be made using [autofpga](https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga), all the way from zero to Hello World successfully in Verilator testing.
